- think about a concrete game idea... :)
    - n-body fighting game
    - shooter
    - jump'n'run
- how to handle game state?

- Simple sprite engine
    - correct scaling
    - translation
    - (collision detection?) -> chipmunk?

- Physics
    X understand chipmunk design
    X write a ball example
    X FPS Graph
    X clean code
        X FPS graph to Statistics.hs
        X Refactor wall generation
        X Refactor ball generation
        X general cleaning (comments, types, ...)

    X move balls around using drag'n'drop
        X find the correct object
        X move it around as long as the user has it clicked.
    - Remove warnings
    - Run HLint
    X simple help on-screen
    - commit & push
    - reddit?

- Since the walls are too thin, balls with large velocity pass through. Make the 
  walls bigger.


-- Nice to have                                                               --
- FPS module
    - definable maximum range
