Game prototypes
===============

You'll find here different game prototypes and tests about game development in
Haskell (probably using OpenGL and Chipmunk).  At the moment this repository
contains the source for a demo of a box with balls, simulated with Chipmunk und
visualized with OpenGL.

You can try the demo cloning or downloading the repository and typing

    cabal configure
    cabal build
    ./dist/build/game/game

Have fun!
